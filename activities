Active Sessions and Queries: Use the sys.dm_exec_requests DMV to see current running queries and their statuses:

SELECT 
    session_id, 
    start_time, 
    status, 
    command, 
    wait_type, 
    wait_time, 
    blocking_session_id, 
    text AS query_text
FROM 
    sys.dm_exec_requests
CROSS APPLY 
    sys.dm_exec_sql_text(sql_handle);


Blocked Sessions: Check for blocking with this query
SELECT 
    blocking_session_id AS BlockingSession, 
    session_id AS BlockedSession, 
    wait_type, 
    wait_time, 
    wait_resource, 
    text AS BlockedQuery 
FROM 
    sys.dm_exec_requests
CROSS APPLY 
    sys.dm_exec_sql_text(sql_handle)
WHERE 
    blocking_session_id <> 0;


Long-Running Queries: Identify queries that are taking longer than a specific threshold (e.g., 1 minute):

SELECT 
    session_id, 
    start_time, 
    DATEDIFF(SECOND, start_time, GETDATE()) AS DurationSeconds, 
    text AS LongRunningQuery 
FROM 
    sys.dm_exec_requests
CROSS APPLY 
    sys.dm_exec_sql_text(sql_handle)
WHERE 
    DATEDIFF(SECOND, start_time, GETDATE()) > 60;

Wait Statistics: Check which types of waits are impacting the system the most:

SELECT 
    wait_type, 
    wait_time_ms / 1000.0 AS WaitTimeSeconds, 
    waiting_tasks_count, 
    (wait_time_ms / 1000.0) / waiting_tasks_count AS AvgWaitTimePerTaskSeconds
FROM 
    sys.dm_os_wait_stats
ORDER BY 
    WaitTimeSeconds DESC;


System Resource Usage: View resource utilization (CPU, memory, etc.) with:
SELECT 
    SQLProcessUtilization, 
    SystemIdleProcess, 
    100 - SystemIdleProcess - SQLProcessUtilization AS OtherProcesses 
FROM 
    sys.dm_os_ring_buffers 
WHERE 
    ring_buffer_type = N'RING_BUFFER_SCHEDULER_MONITOR'
    AND record_id = (SELECT MAX(record_id) FROM sys.dm_os_ring_buffers 
                     WHERE ring_buffer_type = N'RING_BUFFER_SCHEDULER_MONITOR');

Identify Top CPU-Consuming Queries:
SELECT 
    TOP 5 
    total_worker_time / 1000 AS CPUTime_ms, 
    execution_count, 
    text AS Query 
FROM 
    sys.dm_exec_query_stats
CROSS APPLY 
    sys.dm_exec_sql_text(sql_handle)
ORDER BY 
    total_worker_time DESC;

Database File I/O and Latency: Identify which files or drives are experiencing the most I/O waits:
SELECT 
    DB_NAME(fs.database_id) AS DatabaseName,
    mf.name AS LogicalName,
    mf.physical_name,
    io_stall_read_ms, 
    num_of_reads, 
    io_stall_write_ms, 
    num_of_writes
FROM 
    sys.dm_io_virtual_file_stats(NULL, NULL) AS fs
JOIN 
    sys.master_files AS mf ON fs.database_id = mf.database_id 
    AND fs.file_id = mf.file_id;
